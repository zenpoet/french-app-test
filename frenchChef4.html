<!-- ADD INTERVIEW HERE -->
    <h3> Who is your inspiration?</h3>
    <p>My Inspiration is a man named Chef Beno. Chef Beno was the chef de cuisine at really 
    fancy restaurant called Persay. His restaurant was rated three michelin stars. I really 
    admire how he demands respect from all of his staff. He is humble and strict but 
    everybody still likes and respects him. 
 </p>
    <h3> What is the funniest/weirdest experience you have with a customer?</h3>
    

    <p>I have had a ton of funny and weird experiences with customers. Once I fell down 
    the stairs with a plate of spaghetti. I was waitering a ten course restaurant and a 
    man would put all of his silverware and drinks at the very edge. Eventually, I caught
     on and placed the silverware at the edge. He would put the the silverware out a 
     little bit. Another time I was working at a restaurant and I was dared to present a
      plate of chocolate to two australians in an australian accent. These kinds of 
      experiences usually happen once a week. 
</p>
    <h3>
Since you are the co-owner to both Fleurie and Petit Pois, what are the differences 
between the two restaurants? </h3>
    
    <p>Well, Fleurie is very formal with white table cloths and different glasses for
     each type of drink. Also, we get the ingredients from different places and the 
     ingredients for Fleurie are very expensive. Petit pois is less fancy and expensive
      and a little more rustic looking. Also, Petit Pois is more in touch with the 
      community. We supported a school that had a garden but didn't have enough money for 
      food to plant so we bought it for them. 
</p>
    <h3>How do you recognize a good chef?</h3>
    <p> <a href="recipe.petitpois.html" class="clue" target="_blank">
A good chef is clean, calm, in control, orderly, open to learning, sometimes a little
 bossy, and holds high standards with himself and his staff. He/she earns respect and has 
 an open mind. A good chef is up for learning and to be the best he/she can be.</a>
