<!-- ADD INTERVIEW HERE -->
<h2>Ashley Clarke, Private Chef</h2>
    <h3>What is your French Connection?</h3>
    <p>I was trained in French cooking and went to France four times.</p>
    <h3>What got you interested in French cuisine and cooking?</h3>
    <p>I was interested in French cooking because I love food and my mom cooked 
    a lot. I majored in French Cuisine in Culinary school.
</p>
    <h3>How long have you been cooking?</h3>
    <p>I have been cooking for 10 years.</p>
    <h3>What training do you have?</h3>
    <p>I was trained in French, Italian, and Thai cuisine.</p>
    <h3>What is your favorite dish?</h3>
    <p>My favorite dish is Tarte Tatin, an upside down apple pie.</p>
    <h3>Who is your inspiration?</h3>
    <p>My mom or Grandma, they cooked a lot and entertained for very large 
    groups of people.</p>
    <h3>What is the hardest dish you have ever made, and why?</h3>
    <!-- WHATEVER TEXT IN THE INTERVIEW IS THE CLUE, USE THIS CODE -->
      <a href="recipe.ashley.html" class="clue" target="_blank">
    <p>Puff pastry because it is layers and layers of folded butter and it 
    takes three days to make. Also it is butter so if you don’t keep it at the right 
    temperature it will melt in your hands. </p></a>
    
    <h3>What are some French speaking countries that you have been to?</h3>
    <p>I have been to Vietnam, the food is really good, and they have really 
    good French pastries. Since it is cheap, you can get really nice pastry for 
    twenty-five cents or less when the cost would normally be four dollars.</p>
