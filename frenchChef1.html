<!-- ADD INTERVIEW HERE -->
   <h3>What is your French connection?</h3>
    <p>My father was in the air force in the 50’s and 60’s and he lived in France. 
    He and my mom had lots of great friends and experiences in France and they brought 
    those experiences to us (their kids). They both spoke French and taught us some when
     we were little. I went to France in sixth grade and all I wanted to do was eat because
      the bakeries were so amazing, so I ate my way through France. I went to school in 
      France in college for a semester and eventually moved back with my former spouse 
      who was in the army, and we lived in France for four years, and that’s where I went 
      to cooking school and worked in a bakery. 
 </p>
    <h3>You said you worked in a French bakery?</h3>

    <p><a href="recipe.paradox.html" class="clue" target="_blank">I worked in the neighborhood bakery and it was amazing. We made all the good stuff, 
    croissants, baguettes, tarts, tartlets and lots of French breads. I traded them my 
    chocolate chip cookie recipe for their baguette recipe. 
      Now in a bakery in France they sell a cookie called “Le cookie de Jenny”.</a>
</p>
    <h3>When did you first know you wanted to be a baker?</h3>
    <p>When I was six I knew I wanted to be a baker, in fact I have proof of my first 
    icing recipe on the wall of my bakery. I was partially inspired by my mom who was 
    an avid baker. On top of loving to bake, my family loved to eat sweets so much that 
    we would typically eat dessert before our main meal. In pursuit of becoming a baker 
    I first worked at a French bakery where I learned the art of baking pastries and 
    other breads.
