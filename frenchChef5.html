<!-- ADD INTERVIEW HERE -->
<h2>Patrick and Jason, MarieBette Café</h2>

   <h3>What motivated you to become a baker?</h3>
    <p>(Patrick) I was working with an artist and we travelled to Spain for a show that he did.  
    We went to this amazing restaurant in Galicia, Spain and there was this 10 course Michelin 
    star meal we had.  I always wanted to go to culinary school, but that’s what inspired me 
    to enroll in culinary school in New York. </p>
    <p>(Jason)  I went to College for pre-med and went to France for a semester.  Then I 
    decided that I didn’t want to be stuck in school for 4 years.  I wanted a job where I
     could travel, so I started working in advertising, thinking it would be a creative 
     field, but it wasn’t very fulfilling for me.  What I really wanted was to have my own 
     business one day.  I really enjoy cooking and entertaining, so I thought: why not go 
     to culinary school?</p>

    <h3>What is a typical day for you?</h3>
    <p>(Patrick)  During the week, I try to be at the bakery at 4:00am.  It gives me enough
     time for the croissants to proof and just to bake all the products before 7:00am, and 
     then I am baking the bread throughout the morning and preparing for the next day.  
     This is a 10 to 12 hour job, seven days a week.  Eventually, we will have a day off!</p>

    <h3>How do you make chocolate croissants?</h3>
<p>Flour, water, milk, yeast, salt, sugar, butter, egg wash on top.

	The process takes a few days, because on day 1 we ferment the flour overnight, on day 2 we make the 
  dough and let it sit overnight, on day 3 we make the croissants, and on day 4 we bake them.</a>

    </p>
    <h3>Now what? What is the future for MarieBette?</h3>
    <p>Getting the process in place so we can focus more on the menu, with seasonal ingredients.</p>
