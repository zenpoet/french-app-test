<!-- ADD INTERVIEW HERE -->
    <h3>What is your French connection?</h3>
    <p>(Toan) My grandfather was the ambassador to Japan for the French government, so my father 

was a French citizen. He was at the Sorbonne where my mom was attending The University 

of Paris. They met there. Since my father was a French citizen, I was a French citizen. 

I was born in Vietnam but my education was in French. When I was ten, I moved to 

Belgium for three years, where they speak French. Then we came to America. But 

later for my job, I was stationed in Paris, so I moved back. There’s a lot of connection. </p>
 
    
    <h3>How did you get into opening a restaurant?</h3>
    <p>(Toan) This was not my idea.<!-- WHATEVER TEXT IN THE INTERVIEW IS THE CLUE, USE THIS CODE -->

We had a huge place here where we had a business of 

making and displaying furniture. I have a degree in architecture, so my interest is in 

design and furnishing. My daughter, who was eight at the time, saw the room up 

front and said “Dad, why don’t you make a coffee shop up there? That will bring people 

in. Then they’ll sit at your tables and they’ll look at your shelves. It’s a way of getting 

people in.” In fact, she even named the place C’ville Coffee. My wife and I named it Perspective, 

because it's  a double entendre,  a  double meaning. “Perspective” because of an 

architectural meaning, as well as the idea that we share a different perspective on 

life. Again, my daughter said, “Dad, if I stopped at the Harris Street stop light, and I look and 

I saw “Perspective,” I would never know it’s a coffee shop. I would think it’s a frame 

shop or something.” So we said, “That’s right! So what would you call it?” And that’s 

how C’ville Coffee was created and named.</p>
    
    <h3>What does a chef eat at night?</h3>
<p>(Toan) I go home and I have ramen noodles. You’re so busy, and you’re sick of your food. You’ve been looking at it and cooking it, you just want something really simple.</p>
    
    <h3>What is your favorite place to visit?</h3>
    <p>(Toan) Paris.  In fact, walking every street of Paris is on my bucket list. Not drive; walk. I’ve 

walked over 600 miles of Paris already. So I have this huge map and I color code 

every trip that I make.</p>
    
    <h3>How do you recognize a good chef (as an employee)?</h3>
    <p>(Toan) That person has to get along with all the people. That person has to gain respect by 

earning it. The title of chef isn’t enough to just boss people around. Here, we lead by 

example. A chef has to be a good leader.</p>
