<!-- ADD INTERVIEW HERE -->
<h2>Hassan, Aroma's Cafe</h2>
  
     <h3>What is your French connection?</h3>
    <p>Born in Morocco, Raised in France, Canadian citizen and proud American.</p>
    
    <h3>Is any of your family in the food services industry?</h3>
     <p> All my family is in the food services industry. My brother Paul used to have one 
     of the biggest resturants in Monteal. My other brother moved to South Africa and 
     opened a restaurant called Carbon Café.</p>

 <h3>What is your favorite dish?</h3>
    <p>Cooking lamb. Braised slowly and could be served different ways over risotto or 
    over couscous. That is my favorite dish
</p>
    <p>
        <h3>How do you recognize a good chef when you are looking for staff?</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of different ways. The education, the school, the place where he did 
work, but I always give people the chance to learn. And and give him onions, see how 
he’s going to cut them.

      <a href="recipe.aroma.html" class="clue" target="_blank">And make an omelet which means, if you’ve seen the movie The Hundred-Foot Journey, 
   remember when he make her the omelet and she hires him? It’s true in France if you 
   don’t know how to make an omelet they won’t hire you
</a>
    
    <h3> What is the funniest or weirdest expirence you've ever had with a costumer? </h3>
    
    <p> The funniest and weirdest one I will say was in France. I used to work for a 
    4 star hotel and restaurant, high class and very strict. There was one customer. 
    I still remember her name, she was from a very wealty family and she used to sit 
    down and, so nobody sat near her, pay for the whole row of tables. She even had a 
    poodle and I was assigned to wait on her and feed her dog. I was young, and one day 
    she invited me to some seminar she wanted to give at the hotel and I prefered to go 
    dancing with my friend so I didn't go. The next day I came, she had her cane and she 
    got so upset she hit me on the head with the cane. It's true I still remember this 
    one. She hit me one time and I said something like "oh", and she said she was insulted
     I didn't come to the seminar. I said I was sorry, but when I came to the table she was 
     still upset and she hit me again with the cane. The directir of the hotel came and 
     he punished me for two weeks. I washed dishes. That is the funniest and weirdest 
     experience. </p>
